# Comparative Meta RNA-Seq Data Standardized Analysis Pipeline
Comparative Meta RNA-Seq Data Standardized Analysis Pipeline (CMRP) is a processing frame for the standardized analysis of Meta RNA-Seq raw data from wide-ranged species.

## Motivation
The development of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) techniques has provided efficient methods to analyze whole transcriptomes, allowing for a full detection of the transcriptomic response of organisms under various conditions. Comparative transcriptomics analysis insights of comparaing gene expression across species, while meta-analysis provides methods of comparative analysis cross different studies. Here we defined a pipeline, CMRP, using the raw data of RNA-Seq datasets from published papers, processed with constant protocols for various species, and finally conducted with two integration methods of differential expression analysis.
