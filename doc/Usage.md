## Prepare

### Set up the structure of folder
- After downloading and unpacking this pipeline from Github, set the path for ___CMRP___.   

  ```SHELL
  ## For example, the path of CMRP directory is /Users/user_name/CMRP ##
  echo 'export CMRP_PATH=/Users/user_name/CMRP'  >> ~/.bash_profile
  ```

- Generate a text file with accession numbers of all needed datasets (check the example in ___$CMRP_PATH/sample/list_of_projectnames___).

- Go to your working directory, starting with constructing a folder structure for data analysis.

  Here we named an example folder as ___rnaseq___. Under ___rnaseq___, run the following command.
  ```SHELL
  source $CMRP_PATH/script/section0.1_setup.sh list_of_projectnames
  ```

  Or manage your input datasets as the following structure:

![folder-structure](https://github.com/rubysheng/CMRP/blob/bombina/pics/dir_structure.png)

## Download datasets

CMRP includes a small utility ___$CMRP_PATH/script/section0.3_download.sh___ for downloading raw data from published RNA-Seq experiments by their database accession numbers.

- Manually save FTP links into the newly generated foler ___rnaseq/download_input___.

  Datasets containing multiple runs were downloaded from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) through a list of FTP links, obtained from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA).  
  An example input link file were provided under the ___$CMRP_PATH/sample/download_input/___ folder.
- Download raw data in a batch with [Ascp](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK158898/), a tool allowing to quickly download a batch of data by links.
  ```SHELL
  source $CMRP_PATH/script/section0.3_download.sh list_of_projectnames
  ```

## Clean data
Raw data and cleaned data quality checks were performed using the [FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc) and [MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/). `MultiQC` is useful to generate the combined reports of quality check for several runs.

RNA-Seq data quality control using [Trim Galore](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/) included low-quality base calls (using default Phred score 20) trimming, adaptor auto-detection and trimming, and short reads filtering (the default minimum length cut-off was 20 bp).

- For every single dataset, go to its own directory under ___rnaseq/data/___, and run with the `1`st step of CMRP ___$CMRP_PATH/script/section1_pipeline_ui.sh___
  ```SHELL
  source $CMRP_PATH/script/section1_pipeline_ui.sh
  ```
  Check the example output [reports](https://github.com/rubysheng/CMRP/blob/bombina/sample/output/qc_report) after quality control.

## Obtain Assembly

To reduce the number of input files and decrease the computational complexity and processing time, data normalization was performed using [Trinity](https://github.com/trinityrnaseq/trinityrnaseq/wiki) separately from and before de novo assembly. The targeted maximum coverage for reads was 50, while the Kmer size and the maximum percent of the mean for the standard deviation of Kmer coverage across reads were both using the default value, 25 and 200, respectively.

- For every single dataset, go to its own directory under ___rnaseq/data/___, and run with the `2`nd, and/or `3`rd step of CMRP.
  ```SHELL
  source $CMRP_PATH/script/section1_pipeline_ui.sh
  ```

De novo assembly with Trinity was also carried out in [Galaxy](http://usegalaxy.org) using default parameter settings. Assemblies were assessed by basic contig N50 statistics, which specifies the length of the shortest contig that can cover 50% of the total genome length.

## Quantify gene expression

Transcript mapping and quantifying back to the assembly were performed using the plugin in `Trinity`. RNA-seq by Expectation-Maximization (RSEM) was used to estimate the contigs abundance in an alignment-based algorithm with corrections for transcript lengths. Briefly, RESM assumes that each sequence read and read length are observed (one end for single reads and both ends for paired reads) and are generated according to a directed acyclic graph that includes parent sequence, length, start position and orientation.  A Bayesian version of the expectation-maximization algorithm is used to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the model parameters, transcript fractions and posterior mean estimates of abundances. The resulting gene expression matrices were then normalized to Transcripts Per Kilobase Million (TPM) to make them comparable across samples. The original TPM matrix generated from the Trinity plugin included all gene names in each dataset. For each dataset, the expression matrix was transformed into a long format with gene names, sample names and TPM values.

## Predict peptides sequences

[TransDecoder](https://github.com/TransDecoder/TransDecoder/wiki) was used to predict coding regions from transcripts, and consequently provided the amino acid sequences used in further analysis.

For generating an efficient index system, we changed headers of sequences by their original project accession numbers and their species codes (including specific Taxonomy codes).

To rename header and predict the protein sequences, prepare a list of target directories with absolute paths which can find transcripts sequences fasta files like __Trinity.fasta.RSEM.transcripts.fa__.

Under the same Taxonomy-level directory as the list file mentioned above, create a output folder to hold the protein sequence files and quantification matrices before prediction.

```SHELL
mkdir $CMRP_PATH/sample/orthologs/ortho_prep_output
source $CMRP_PATH/script/section2.1_header_and_predict.sh -l $CMRP_PATH/sample/orthologs/input_dir_list -o $CMRP_PATH/sample/orthologs/ortho_prep_output 2>&1 | tee prep.log
```

## Search Orthologs

Orthologous gene groups were clustered using an automated pipeline for [OrthoMCL](https://github.com/stajichlab/OrthoMCL), called [Orthomcl-pipeline](https://github.com/apetkau/orthomcl-pipeline).

Follow the manual of Orthomcl-pipeline. In this tool, all-versus-all Blast search with Opening Reading Frames provided the score of pairwise sequence similarity. Blast used the default setting except for E-value cut-off, which was different based on the diversity of species (or higher-level taxonomy groups). Then all matching pairs were filtered with “percent match length” (>= 50% left) and linked across or within the objects (species or class) for identifying the orthologs or in-paralogs pairs. Finally, the clustering of orthologs gene groups used Markov Clustering (MCL) algorithms.

[Back to top](#usage-the-cmrp)

### Integrate across taxonomy groups
The output of orthomcl-pipeline search would be a list of groups including the orthologous protein sequence headers, which are used to extract corresponding protein sequences, transcript sequences, quantification numbers and gene mapping information for further analysis.

Under the same Taxonomy-level directory mentioned at previous section, run the extraction step.

```SHELL
source $CMRP_PATH/script/section2.2_extract.sh 2>&1 | tee extract_by_header.log
```

To allow analyzing data from a wide range of species, orthologs searching was required to identify the orthologous gene groups. For large amount of orthologs searching among distantly related species, datasets would be split into several groups based on the taxonomy group of their experiment objects.

Orthologs searching was performed at two levels- clustering intraclass and clustering interclass. The general process involved 1) in-parallel orthologs searching within each class; 2) filtering clustered genes from those OGGs that contained orthologous genes from all species in one class; 3) integrating filtered genes from 5 classes for interclass orthologs searching; and 4) filtering clustered genes from those OGGs that contained orthologous genes from all classes.

If the input datasets had to conduct with the interclass orthologs searching followed by some filtering, the cross-class OGGs would be obtained, defined as orthologs groups (or cOGGs).

[Back to top](#usage-the-cmrp)

### Annotate orthologous groups

From each orthologs group (or cOGG), only all clustered Mammalia sequences would be extracted for annotation because they had much more well-developed and high-quality gene annotation database. Annotation of Mammalia proteins (using BlastP) and transcripts (using BlastX) were against the UniProt database obtained from [Trinotate](http://trinotate.github.io).

The E-value cut-off for both were 10-3; BlastP only kept the most common target, while BlastX returned the top 5 hits; other parameters were set as defaults except for the parallel threads using the maximum cores. Protein sequences were also searched against a protein profile HMM database.

Trinotate generated the final report. After annotation, only the most frequent gene symbol from BlastX and annotated with Gene Ontology (GO) terms in biological processes for each orthologs group (or cOGG) was selected as the representative annotation identifier. When duplicate identifiers occurred, the second most frequent gene symbol was applied to the orthologs group (or cOGG) with the most frequency of its second-most gene symbol.

Under a selected Taxonomy-level directory (such as rodent), run the extraction step.

```SHELL
source $CMRP_PATH/script/section2.3_annotation_represent.sh 2>&1 | tee annotation.log
```

[Back to top](#usage-the-cmrp)

### Compare expression of orthologous groups

Obtatin Trinotate report examople by using the following commandline.
```SHELL
tar -zxvf $CMRP_PATH/sample/orthologs/annotation/anno_output/allRD_trinotate_annotation_report.xls.tar.gz
```

Rename and extract the expression values for orthologs in each dataset.
```SHELL
mkdir expression_matrix
cd expression_matrix
source $CMRP_PATH/script/section2.4_express_matrix.sh -l expressionMX_input_dir_list 2>&1 | tee express_matrix.log

# at "$CMRP_PATH/sample/orthologs/expression_matrix/"
source $CMRP_PATH/script/section2.4.1_exp_extract.sh ../annotation/RD_uniq_dna.lst  2>&1 | tee exp_extract.log

```

Run with the following R scripts to help analyze the data generate final tables.
```SHELL
